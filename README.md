# Machine-Learning-Heart-Disease-Classifier
This is a group project that consisted of 4 people.

We identified the variables we may use to precisely predict if a patient has heart disease using the cleveland.data dataset offered by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This was done using R and the tidymodels package.
